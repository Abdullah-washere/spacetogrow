How to Run the Project:

Install the latest version of the Arduino IDE.
Install the necessary add-ons of the Arduino board used in the project.
Download the project code from [insert GitHub link].
Open the Arduino IDE and navigate to File > Open.
Select the downloaded project code file.
Install the required libraries (RTCLib by NeiroN, Adafruit Neopixel, Adafruit Neomatrix, Adafruit GFX) either through the Arduino IDE Library Manager or by manually installing them.
Connect the Arduino board to your computer.
Select the appropriate board (e.g., "NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP-12E Module)") from Tools > Board menu.
Upload the code to the Arduino board.
Ensure you are using a wire that has dIn and dOut to upload the code to the board.
If any errors occur, check for correct library installation and verify the board settings.
Enjoy the captivating LED display installation!
Note: This project was developed as part of a Physical Computing and Creative Computing project at our university.
